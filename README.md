# Description: 
This repository contains 8 .csv files containing annual PRISM climate data averaged over two different region partitions from 2005 to 2019: NOAA Climate regions <noaaregions> and EPA ecoregions <ecoregions>. Averages are available for 4 climate variables: annual mean average temperature <annual_tmean>, annual minimum average temperature <annual_tmin>, annual maximum average temperature <annual_tmax>, and annual cumulative precipitation <ppt>. File names are in the format: PRISM_<variable>_2005_2019_<regions>.csv

Each .csv file is ~4 KB in size.
